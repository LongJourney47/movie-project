# Movie-Project (Udemy Project)

## Description
The project was created with the intent to compare movie data gathered via Axios from the OMDb API site. The porject uses a widget system to display brief information of movies upon user input such as an image,summary, & genre. When a two movies are selected in both search fields a new list for the movie becomes visible with information that has a numerical value such as box office earnings, rewards, review rating, and more. An automatic color system as also implemented where green represents the categories a movie "won" in & yellow what the movie "lost" in, when compared to the other. The desgin was taken care of via Bulma, a free open sourced CSS framework.

## Instructions
* Upon page load up two search fields will be displayed with a title indicating to use them.
* Input virtually any movie that comes to mind.
* A widget will then become visible with a selection of movies based on user input.
* After entering a movie in both, more details of the movies will appear with automatic color comparisons being made.
